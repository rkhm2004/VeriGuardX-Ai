sqlalchemy==2.0.23
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
# Commented out because building psycopg2 from source requires PostgreSQL dev
# tools (pg_config) which are not available in many Windows dev environments.
# If you need PostgreSQL support, install the OS PostgreSQL dev package or
# restore this line and ensure `pg_config` is on PATH.

# The above ML libraries are compiled packages that often require
# a C/C++ build toolchain on Windows. Commented out to allow
# `pip install -r requirements.txt` to complete in lightweight
# dev environments. Re-enable if you have wheels or a suitable
# build toolchain (or use conda for prebuilt binaries).
